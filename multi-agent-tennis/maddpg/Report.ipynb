    "In this work, both state and action spaces are continuous. An multi-agent actor-critic approach is used to estimate continuous actions. Specifically, a multi-agent approach based on **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient** [DDPG](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) called **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Agent** [MADDPG](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275) is used to model two agents competing in tennis. To accommodate and ease learning in continuous action spaces, batch normalization is applied to normalize state. Both actor and critic starts with batch normalization of input states. An actor comprises 2 hidden layers with 128 units, batch normalization, and a ReLU activation, and an output layer with dimension equal to the dimension of action space and a tanh activation since values of an action range from -1 to 1. \n",

    "### 1.2 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n",
    "[Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) similar to a deep Q network (DQN) is an off-policy learning algorithm, which learns to maximize an expected return based on an action-value function. Unlike DQN, according to [Lillicrap et al.](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) and [Silver et al.](!https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3044850), (deep) DPG is an actor-critic algorithm. It, however, is different from typical actor-critic approaches in which a critic incorporates bootstrapping as in TD-based methods to reduce variances introduced by an actor formulated as a Monte Carlo policy gradient method. DDPG maintains 4 neural networks (instead of 2 as in DQN): 2 for target and behaviour policy networks and 2 for target and learned Q networks. The policy networks are also called actor networks and the Q networks are also called critic networks. <br>\n",
