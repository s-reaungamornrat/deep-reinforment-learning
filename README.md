# Deep reinforcement learning

A repository contains projects developed for the [Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning NanoDegree program](!https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). Each project has its own `README.md` stored in the project folder.

# Getting Started

**Prerequisites** are described in the `README.md` of each project. All the projects, however, were developed based on python 3.6 and [pytorch](!https://pytorch.org/). It is highly recommended to create a new conda environment using the [following command](!https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands), so any mistakes are contained within the environment and can be [removed](!https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#removing-an-environment). To create an environment, use the following command
```
conda create --name your_env_name
```
where `your_env_name` is the name of your conda environment. After that, one can activate the environment and install all required python libraries. Activate an environment in *Windows*, use
```
activate your_env_name
```
and in *Linux*, use
```
source activate your_env_name
```
Then `python 3.6` and other libraries can be installed as
```
conda install python=3.6 numpy matplotlib
```
The command used to install pytorch depends on system configuration. The configuration suited to your machine and pytorch installation command can be found on the [pytorch webpage](!https://pytorch.org/).
