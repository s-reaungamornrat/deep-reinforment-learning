    "In this work aside from the state space, the action space is also continuous. Actor-critic models are used to approximate continuous actions. To accommodate and ease learning in this continuous action space, batch normalization is applied to normalize state . Both actor and critic starts with batch normalization of input states. An actor comprises 2 hidden layers with 128 units, batch normalization, and a ReLU activation, and an output layer with dimension equal to the dimension of action space and a tanh activation since values of torques (of an action) range from -1 to 1. \n",

The output layer is just a linear layer with 1 unit returning an action-value function. \n",

    "### 1.2 Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n",
    "[Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) similar to a deep Q network (DQN) is an off-policy learning algorithm, which learns to maximize an expected return based on an action-value function. Unlike DQN, according to [Lillicrap et al.](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) and [Silver et al.](!https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3044850), (deep) DPG is an actor-critic algorithm. It, however, is different from typical actor-critic approaches in which a critic incorporates bootstrapping as in TD-based methods to reduce variances introduced by an actor formulated as a Monte Carlo policy gradient method. DDPG maintains 4 neural networks (instead of 2 as in DQN): 2 for target and behaviour policy networks and 2 for target and up-to-date Q networks. The policy networks are also called actor networks and the Q networks are also called critic networks. <br>\n",

    "- **Correlated samples** samples generated from sequentially exploring an environment are not independently and identically distributed. To address this, transitions ($s_t, a_t,r_t,s_{t+1}$) are stored in a replay buffer and sampled uniformly to update actors and critics, i.e., remove correlation.\n",
    "- **Soft update of target networks** loss functions involves optimized parameters in every term which violates typical gradient calculation and parameter updates in typical optimizers. Soft update makes target network slowly changes, moving the calculation closer to a typically gradient step update for stable optimization problems.\n",
    "- **Varitions in observation values** observations have different physical units and ranges. Batch normalization is used to make the agent generalize better and ease learning. **Both actors and critics start with batch normalization, and all hidden layers of actor networks as well as all hidden layers of critics are prior to an action input are followed by batch normalization**\n",
    "- **Exploration** since DDPG is an off-policy learning algorithm, noise can be added to a behavior policy to induce exploration.\n",
